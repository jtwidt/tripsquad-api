# TripAquad API

## The Repository

This repository houses the API server for the TripSquad application. 

## TripSquad

TripSquad is a trip planning application centering around group trip planning. A trip can be created and modified by a user. Other members can be added and removed from the trip using either referral links or referral codes. Flight and hotel searches can be done from within the trip, with attemps made to coordinate arrival and/or departure times to align schedules as much as possible. Reservations can be tracked with storage of confirmation codes. Daily itineraries can be tracked also, with the option to capture sightseeing items and/or restaurant reservations.
